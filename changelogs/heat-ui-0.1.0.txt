This is the initial Aplha release of the Heat Client Framework also known as
the heat-ui project.

Heat-ui already is a robust and extensible framework for building multi device,
cross OS crypto currency clients.

Out of the box heat-ui runs in your browser on your PC and on your mobile
devices through its use of responsive designed ui controls.

Heat-ui also comes as a Windows installable application, as a MacOS
application (although currently in experimental phase) and as a Linux desktop
application.

Pending target devices are Android and IPhone. All distributions for all
platforms use the same code base.

This Alpha release also is available online at https://alpha.heatledger.com as
a fully functional browser based version.

The goal of this Alpha release is to showcase and test the extensive framework
built by Heat Ledger Ltd.

This alpha version connects to Heat Test Net, we invite anyone to play around
and try it out. When creating a new account new users get 1.000 TEST HEAT for
free.

Functionality in this version consists of blockchain based instant messaging,
sending and receiving Test HEAT and a simple block explorer.
